IMPORTANT: DO NOT DELETE ROWS - IT MESSES WITH THE FORMULAS		
		
STEP 1)	On MindBody, run payroll report for current pay period.  	
	Pay periods:	Paycheck ready on:
	1st until 14th	15th
	15th until last day of month	1st
		
	Export report to excel	
	Read NOTES before getting started	
		
STEP 2)	LOG	
	a) Copy data from excel sheet - Colums A-E for each instructor for weekly classes or workshops	
	b) Paste data into the 'Log' sheet here on the next available Column E	
	c) Add instructor's name onto Column B of pasted cells	
	d) Column C should auto-populate unless it's a workshop or private lesson or it's a sub, then manually enter "Workshop", "Private lesson" or Name of class	
	e) If the instructor had private lessons - copy data from columns A-D from excel sheet and paste into 'Log' column E (date format might have to be fixed)

	Toubleshooting:	
	DO NOT CHANGE ANY FORMULAS IN THE PAY STUB TAB - YOU CAN HIDE ROWS BUT DO NOT DELETE ROWS	
	* Classes information comes from the tab 'Classes'.  If a class is not auto-populated, make sure the class is listed in that tab for the correct instructor.  Classes will not auto-populate until an Instructor is added to column A.	
	* Instructor's name and class name need to match information within the tab 'Classes'	
	* Pricing information comes from the tab 'Pay Rates'.  If a pay rate is not being auto-populate make sure it is listed within this tab.  	
	* Pricing Option name needs to match exactly the wording and spelling listed in the 'Pay Rates' tab	
	REMEMBER - Blue cells autopopulate - do not change unless necessary	
	**In rare cases where two instructors teach together, you'll need to manually change the percentage of pay from 50% to 25%

	g) Do this for each instructor
